# Auto File Renamer Program by Eric .V
Automatically renames files in a folder where the .exe is located, using a random variant of UUIDS.

[2.0] Adds a "Select Folder" function to rename all the files of the specified folder

PD: I'm just a junior programmer starting to do my own Python dabbling.

I made this program to rename some files that kept overlapping when I was backing up Windows.

I hope you find it helpful! ;)
